Abortion is a procedure to end a pregnancy and is available through the NHS or privately. It can be done with medicines or a surgical procedure and is usually available free of charge on the NHS. There are three main ways to get an abortion on the NHS. Most abortions are carried out before 24 weeks of pregnancy and can be done after 24 weeks in very limited circumstances. Before having an abortion, a woman should be given a choice of how she would like it to be done and will have an appointment to talk about her decision. Abortion is a safe procedure, but there is a small risk of complications. It will not affect a woman's chances of getting pregnant again in the future. Advice for treatment: Speak to a trained pregnancy counsellor to get impartial information and support, and discuss your options. Speak to your partner, friends or family, or a trusted adult if you are under 16. Use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant. Take it easy for a few days after the procedure."
